# Restaurant Progressive Web App - In Development

This site uses a Node based GraphQL server to access a Wordpress API initiated through the Wordpress Command Line Interface. This data is displayed with with an Apollo client and a React.js frontend, organized by feature and the data layer separated through containers.

The website is maintained and customized through custom post types, categories, and taxonomies, making it user friendly on the back-end to non-programming individuals.

The front end is styled with a mobile first mentality, using CSS and Styled Components for better separation of components. Data flow is always moving down through the app, with state/data management through containers. It uses default data and caching for an offline experience and faster loading times.

The design of the site was done through Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. The color scheme is entirely comprised of the company's yellow theme color. Even the overlay's, blacks, and whites have a tint of the thematic color, enhancing the overall experience and brand recognition of the site.

After the main features are finished. This will be integrated with a customizable loyalty user interface, built on the same stack.
